# Book Store
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and Redux.


> This is an App that allows users to store names of books and their categories in a `Redux Store` as well delete books from the store.

This **Single Page App**  was built with **React-Redux**. The main page has links to:
- Books Page (Home Page) and 
- Categories Page (irrelevant for the project milestone)

When users input a `Book Title` and select a `Category`, the data is sent to this [Book API](https://www.notion.so/Bookstore-API-51ea269061f849118c65c0a53e88a739) and `onPageLoad`, the data in the API is fectched and stored in a **Redux Store**.

The `Redux Store` is accessible to all components and the data in the store (_state_) can be `retrieved`, `added` to, and `deleted` when **Actions** are dispatched to the store using React-Redux `Hooks`.

The _Authors_, _percentage completed_ and _Chapters_ are generated using a `Math.random()` method. The data gotten from the random selection is concatenated to a body parameter that goes to the API and on retrieval, they are `destructured` and displayed in the **ReactDOM**.
